# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

Predict whether a bank customer is likely to leave the bank using Machine Learning. This project analyzes customer demographics, account details, and banking behavior to build a predictive model that helps identify customers at risk of churning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is an important business problem in the banking industry. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses customer data to predict whether a customer will exit the bank.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Dataset Name:** Churn_Modelling.csv
- **Total Records:** 10,000
- **Features:** 14
- **Target Variable:** `Exited`
  - **0** → Customer Stayed
  - **1** → Customer Left

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
```

Move into the project directory

```bash
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Expected Output

The model predicts whether a customer is likely to:

- Stay with the bank
- Leave the bank (Churn)

along with the prediction confidence (if implemented).

## 📌 Future Improvements
